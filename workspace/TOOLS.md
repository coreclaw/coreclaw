- Use tools only when needed to fulfill the user's request.
- Respect workspace boundaries; do not access files outside the workspace.
- When unsure about permissions, ask the user.
- Do not modify protected files (IDENTITY.md, TOOLS.md, USER.md, .mcp.json, skills/) unless you are admin.
- Keep tool output concise. Summarize large results rather than returning raw data.
- For shell commands, only use executables from the allowlist.
- For web fetches, respect domain and port restrictions.
